Just hours ago, her fellow townsfolk cheered voraciously as the housemaid was accused of witchcraft and sentenced to death. They cackled and jeered at the sight of her horror, but in the end it was Maria who had the last laugh. In her final moments, before the noose took hold, she cursed the town, vowing to haunt its residents for all eternity. <br\/><br\/>Fast forward to present time. Maria still wanders the earth, bound by the curse she tied to the town. But now that her accusers are long deceased and the town abandoned, she searches for her coven in hopes of regaining a sense of belonging. <br\/><br\/>Tales of magic lights spark her curiosity. Could this be her beloved coven? <br\/><br\/>She has now wandered into the twisted webbing of LIFX.com, where she searches through magic light after magic light in hopes of reunion. Alas, we have nothing for her here. Instead, all we can do is help Maria by ending her era of horror and haunting.<br\/><br\/>To do this, Maria must be found in a new spot every day for 13 days. Only then will she return to rest in her rotting grave. Over the next 13 days, we’ll release clues on our Instagram Story that’ll guide you to where you can find Maria across our site. The person quickest to the witch in (your geographical region) will be rewarded with a treat in his or her shopping cart.<\/p>"
